# the distribution instead: they are already built against the system GTK, which
# is the version the application actually runs on.
#
# Two things are required for that to work. The environment has to be created

# does not contain the distribution's bindings. And the packages have to be
# excluded from the sync explicitly.

# whose bindings belong to a different minor version -- and quietly is the
# problem, the answer arriving much later as an ImportError from inside the
# application. scripts/system-python.sh settles it the only way that settles it,
# by importing both, and says what to install when nothing can.
