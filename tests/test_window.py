        Breakpoints apply during allocation, so the loop has to turn: asking
        straight after set_default_size reads the state the window had before
        it was that size.

        The window is destroyed again on the way out, and that is not tidiness.
        A presented window keeps its GApplication alive, and the next test to
        run one under the same application id becomes a remote instance of it
        -- which never activates, so the test after this one fails instead.

        The width is checked rather than assumed, because asking is not getting.
        GTK will not give a window more room than the monitor has, so on a small
        screen a window asked for 1000 points is quietly 640 -- which is under
        the breakpoint, so the wide case read a narrow layout and asserted the
        opposite of what it meant, and passed. scripts/headless-session.sh sets
        a screen big enough now; this is what says so when something else is not.

        Near enough rather than exactly, because get_width() measures the
        widget's allocation and the client-side decorations draw a shadow
        outside it: a window presented at 400 points measures 390, always and
        everywhere. The allowance is loose on purpose. What it has to catch is a
        request that was truncated, and the one that got through was 1000
