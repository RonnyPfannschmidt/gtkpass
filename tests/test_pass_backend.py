"""How the Pass backend invokes pass, inside a sandbox and outside one.

The packaged application bundles pass itself, so there is one answer in both
places: run it from PATH. The alternative -- asking the host to run it through
`flatpak-spawn --host` -- needs a permission that hands the application
arbitrary command execution outside the sandbox, which is not a trade a
password manager should make.
