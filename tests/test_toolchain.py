"""How the project spells the interpreter it builds and tests against.

PyGObject and pycairo come from the distribution, so the environment has to be
created against an interpreter that already has them. That was hardcoded to
``/usr/bin/python3``, which is right on most machines and quietly wrong on one
whose bindings belong to a different minor version -- and quietly is the whole
problem, since the answer arrives much later as an ImportError from inside the
application.

`scripts/system-python.sh` asks instead, and `make test PYTHON=...` is the other
half: one definition of "run the suite" that the development environment, an
installed wheel and an installed RPM can all be pointed at, rather than three
spellings in three places, one of which is a CI workflow nobody reads until it
breaks.
