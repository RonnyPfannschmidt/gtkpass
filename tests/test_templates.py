"""Checks that the compiled UI definitions still match the Python that binds them.

When a widget is renamed in a ``.blp`` but not in its class, PyGObject leaves the
corresponding attribute as ``None`` instead of failing.  The application then
half-works: it starts, and blows up later on whichever code path touches the
missing widget.  These tests turn that into an import-time-ish failure.
