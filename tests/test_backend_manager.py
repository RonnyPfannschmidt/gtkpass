"""What the manager's thread pool does when a worker will not finish.

Every backend operation runs on that pool, and a decrypt sits on a pinentry
prompt that may never be answered. ``shutdown()`` is called from the UI thread
-- at quit, and on every settings change -- so a join on the pool turns one
stuck worker into an application that cannot be closed.

The subprocess deadlines are the other half of this; see
``TestPassCannotRunForever`` in test_pass_backend.py. Neither half is enough on
its own: a deadline still leaves the interface frozen until it expires, and a
non-blocking shutdown still leaves the interpreter joining the pool at exit.
