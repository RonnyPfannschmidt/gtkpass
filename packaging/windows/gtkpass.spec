# PyInstaller spec for the Windows build.  Driven by packaging/windows/build.ps1.
#
# A spec is executed by PyInstaller with Analysis, EXE and COLLECT already in
# scope, so it is not an importable module and nothing else should treat it as
# one.  Its inputs arrive through the environment rather than as arguments,
# which is all PyInstaller offers a spec.
#
# What this has to get right that a plain `pyinstaller gtkpass-launcher.py`
# would not:
#
#   * Gtk 4.0.  PyInstaller's gi hook defaults to Gtk 3.0 and silently collects
#     nothing when that is absent, leaving a bundle that fails at gi.require_version.
#   * The distribution metadata.  Backends are discovered through the
#     `gtkpass.backends` entry point group, which is read out of the installed
#     .dist-info; without it the application starts with no backends at all and
#     nothing in the log to say why.
#   * The backend modules themselves.  Nothing imports them -- the entry point
#     names them as a string -- so PyInstaller's import graph never sees them.
#   * The compiled schema and the icon theme, staged by build.ps1 and picked up
#     here as a directory tree.
