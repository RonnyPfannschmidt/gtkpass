# GTKPass

A GTK4/Libadwaita frontend for password stores on GNOME/Linux, in the spirit of
qtpass.

## Overview

GTKPass is not a password manager of its own: it stores nothing and owns no
format. It is a native GTK4 interface over pluggable backends, one of which
reads and writes the standard [passwordstore](https://www.passwordstore.org/)
layout, so an existing store stays usable from `pass` and every other tool that
speaks it.

## Status

**Early, and honest about it.** The application runs, reads and edits, and is
covered by a test suite. It builds as a Flatpak, an RPM, a systemd-sysext image
and a Windows executable with an installer, and tagging would publish them — but
no release has been made, nothing is signed, and there is no repository to
install from.

What works today:

- Finding the store you already have: an existing `~/.password-store` is
  offered on first run as a button rather than a form
- Configuring several backends at once, each with its own settings
- Browsing entries as a tree, grouped by backend, folders nested by path
- Searching, as you type or on Enter, as the preference says
- Opening an entry: decrypted off the UI thread, and every field it carries
  shown, whether or not GTKPass knows what the field means
- Copying a field, with the clipboard cleared again after a timeout
- Adding an entry, with a generated password if you want one
- Generating by any of three schemes -- random characters, a diceware
  passphrase, or digits for a PIN -- with the entropy of each shown, wherever
  a password is set
- Editing an entry and writing it back through its backend
- Rotating a password: make the replacement, take it to the site, and write the
  store only once you say the change took, so a site that refuses it costs you
  nothing
- Renaming and moving an entry, which are one operation because a name is a path
- Deleting an entry, after being asked about it by name
- A context menu on the sidebar rows, and a keyboard shortcut for everything
- Syncing a git-backed store: pull with rebase, then push, off the UI thread

What does not exist yet: OTP codes, and re-encrypting a store to a changed
recipient set. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Backends

| Backend | Reads | Writes | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Direct GPG | yes | yes | GPG-encrypted files, handled natively |
| Pass | yes | yes | delegates to the `pass` executable |
| Secret Service | yes | yes | the D-Bus keyring service |
| Demo | yes | no | invented entries, for trying the UI out |

Backends are discovered through the `gtkpass.backends` entry point group, so
one can be shipped separately from this repository.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- GTK4 4.10+ and Libadwaita 1.4+
- PyGObject and pycairo, from your distribution rather than from PyPI
- GnuPG 2.x, for the GPG-backed stores

## Running it

There is no release to install. From a checkout:

```bash
make sync      # environment, dependencies and the git hooks
make run       # launch against your real password store
```

To try it out without touching your own passwords:

```bash
make run-dev   # a throwaway store of invented entries under .dev/
```

Or build something installable, none of it released or signed:

```bash
make flatpak   # see docs/FLATPAK.md
make rpm       # an RPM for Fedora
make deb       # a .deb for Debian trixie and Ubuntu 26.04
make sysext    # a systemd-sysext image for Bluefin, Silverblue and the rest
```

`make help` lists the rest; [docs/PACKAGING.md](docs/PACKAGING.md) covers the
Fedora ones and [docs/DEBIAN.md](docs/DEBIAN.md) the .deb. Tagging publishes all of it — see
[docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md) — but no release has been made yet.

On Windows there is no `make`, and GTK comes from the bundle rather than from
the system:

```powershell
pwsh -File packaging\windows\build.ps1   # an .exe, a portable zip and an installer
```

[docs/WINDOWS.md](docs/WINDOWS.md) covers that one, including which backends
work there — the Secret Service is a D-Bus interface and does not.

The distribution is called `gtk-pass-ng` on PyPI: `gtkpass` there belongs to an
unrelated project, and `gtk-pass` was refused as too similar to it. The command,
the package and the RPM all keep this project's name.

## Working on it

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first — it is short, and the first rule in it
matters more than the others: **development code must never read your real
password store.** [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) describes how the pieces
fit together.

## Compatibility

The Direct GPG and Pass backends use the passwordstore format, so a store stays
readable by `pass`, qtpass, and Android Password Store via git sync. Extensions
are not supported yet — `pass-otp` and `pass-update` are the two intended, and
until they land an OTP secret is shown as the secret it is, masked with the
other fields that are secrets, rather than turned into a code.

## Security

- Entries are decrypted only when opened, and the plaintext is dropped when the
  view moves on
- Decrypted content is kept out of logs, reprs and assertion diffs on purpose
- The clipboard is cleared after a configurable delay, as damage limitation
  rather than a guarantee — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
- Code running out of a checkout is blocked from opening the real store or the
  keyring, so development and test runs cannot read real passwords
