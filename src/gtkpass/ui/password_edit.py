"""Dialog for editing one password entry.

An entry is free text: the password on the first line, and whatever the store
happens to keep after it. The dialog splits on exactly that boundary and joins
it back, because what it hands over replaces the entry wholesale -- anything it
dropped on the way would be lost.

Nothing here logs its contents. The widgets hold plaintext while the dialog is
open, which is unavoidable for an editor, but it must not leak any further.
