"""Dialog for adding one password entry.

The `+` button opened a "Not Implemented Yet" dialog for as long as there has
been a `+` button, while every backend that can write has implemented
``add_password`` all along. This is what was missing.

As with the editor, nothing here writes anything: the dialog emits ``added``
and the window decides which backend to put it through and how to report a
failure.
