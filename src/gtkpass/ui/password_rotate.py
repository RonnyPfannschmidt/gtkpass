"""The rotation wizard: replacing a password without losing the account.

Rotating is what people reach for most often after reading an entry, and doing
it through the editor gets the order wrong. The editor writes the store first
and the site second, so a site that refuses the new password -- too long, no
symbols, a change form that fails halfway -- leaves the store holding a
password that does not work, and the account reachable only through a reset.

So this puts the store last. Make the replacement, put it into the site, say
whether that worked, and only then write. Until the last page is confirmed the
store still holds the password that works, and this keeps that one on screen
where it can be copied: a change form asks for the current password first.

Nothing here writes anything and nothing here touches the clipboard. It emits
``rotated`` and ``copy-requested``, and the window -- which owns the backends
and the one clipboard that gets cleared on a timer -- does both.
